For Editors
===========

An editor can only open the Newt module in the backend.

There the editor will find the QR-Code, which he can scan with the Newt app.

After the configuration has been created, the editor receives a list of the configured endpoints in the app.

He can then use these endpoints as long as the token is valid.
